      <h2 id="about">About</h2>
        <p>I was born in Iran, but moved to California when I was 2 years old! I've been in Orange County the majority of my life since, except when I attended UCLA to earn my Bachelors. I majored in Political Science and Philosophy, but I have always had an interest in coding since I was young.</p>
        <p>When I was in Middle School, I dabbled in CSS through a website that allowed for customizing personal forum pages. And then in High School I learned some light coding through an AP Computer Science course. I then entered Community College with the intention of majoring in Computer Science, but ended up taking a Political Science route instead.</p>
        <p>After falling out of love with Political Science and spending the last few years in the sales industry, I decided that it was time to come back to an original passion of mine, in the form of a Software Engineering Bootcamp through <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/" target="_blank"><strong><u>Thinkful!</u></strong></a></p>
        <p>Doing so has felt like one of the best decisions I've made, as I am enjoying every day doing what I have a passion for once again! If you're looking for a dedicated, hardworking software developer, then look no further! Please reach out with any considerations!</p>
